# üßÆ Basic-Calculator-Program

## üìã Description

This is an easy Python calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations:  
**Addition**, **Subtraction**, **Multiplication**, and **Division**.

The program prompts the user to:
- Enter the first number  
- Enter the second number  
- Choose an `operation_sign` from the following:  
  `+(addition)`, `-(subtraction)`, `*(multiplication)`, `/(division)`

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Rule

1. To choose the `operation_sign`, **you must type both the symbol and the word**, exactly as shown.  

### ‚úÖ Example:
```bash
$ python calculator.py
Enter the first number: 2
Enter the second number: 3
Enter operation_sign (+(addition), -(subtraction), *(multiplication), /(division)): +(addition)
2.0 + 3.0 = 5.0

$ python calculator.py
Enter the first number: 4
Enter the second number: 2
Enter operation_sign (+(addition), -(subtraction), *(multiplication), /(division)): /(division)
4.0 / 2.0 = 2.0

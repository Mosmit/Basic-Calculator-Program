# Basic-Calculator-Program

## Description

This is an easy Python calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations: **addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication**, and **division**.

The program prompts the user to:
- Enter the first number  
- Enter the second number  
- Choose an operation_sign (`+(addition)`, `-(substraction)`, `*(multiplication)`, `/(division)`)

## Important Rule
1. To choose the operation_sign, you must chose the sign and type it in words aswell, example is shown below:
    $ python calculator.py
        Enter the first number: 2
        Enter the second number: 3
        Enter operation_sign (+(addition), -(substraction), *(multiplication), /(division)): +(addition)
        2.0 + 3.0 = 5.0
    $ python calculator.py
        Enter the first number: 4
        Enter the second number: 2
        Enter operation_sign (+(addition), -(substraction), *(multiplication), /(division)): /(division)
        4.0 / 2.0 = 2.0

Then it calculates and displays the result.

2. **python calculator.py** is used to run the program, before being prompted.
